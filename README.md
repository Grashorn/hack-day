# Git Merge - Hack Day

Saturday, May 11th is the **Hack Day** of Git Merge Berlin. 

There will be some coordination at the beginning of the day and time to break into groups and start working.  At the end of the day there will be time set aside to share some of the things you've done.

## Create an Issue

If you want to hack on something, **start an issue in this repository** so that other people that might be interested in that same hack project can find you and help you.  Propose what you would like to build and what skills you need to get it done.

## Hack Day Notes

In the docs/ subdirectory of this repository we would like to document what was worked on during the day.  If you start a project, fork this repository, try to document it in a file in this subdirectory (ie: `docs/my-project.md`) and at the end of the day submit a pull request so all of the projects documentation (what it does, why you worked on it, a link to the repo or website, etc) is in a single place.
